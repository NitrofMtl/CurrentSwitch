# CurrentSwitch
Sketch to interface with arduino to use SCT-013-000 current sensor as a workproof


CurrentSwitch Is a library to use non invasive current probe to use it a a 'working proof'. 
This skecht use a SCT-013-000. Interface with arduino here and original emonLib library:
 ***************  https://github.com/openenergymonitor/EmonLib  *************

Instead of emonLib that read real current, this on only return 'true' if there is 'some current'. 
This is usefull usefull as workproof and very weightless compare to emonLib.
